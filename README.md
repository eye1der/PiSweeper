# PiSweeper

PiSweeper is a Python-based Minesweeper clone built with a graphical interface using Tkinter.

**How is it different? Just like the original version it has the Smart Number Reveal feature.** No other clones have this to my knowledge  

It's a fun and engaging way to enjoy the classic game of Minesweeper right on your desktop!

## Features

- **Difficulty Levels**: Choose between Beginner (8x8, 10 mines), Intermediate (16x16, 40 mines), and Expert (30x16, 99 mines).
- **Intuitive Interface**: Left-click to reveal cells and right-click to flag mines.
- **Smart Number Reveal**: Click on a revealed numbered cell to uncover all unrevealed surrounding cells (skipping flagged ones).
- **Winning Logic**: Win by flagging all mines or revealing all non-mine cells.
- **Restart Option**: Restart the game or choose a new difficulty after a game over.
- **Dynamic Feedback**: Visual updates for revealed cells, flagged mines, and game status.

## How to Play

1. **Left-Click**: Reveal a cell.
2. **Right-Click**: Place or remove a flag to mark a suspected mine.
3. **Click Numbered Cells**: Click a revealed number to uncover all adjacent unrevealed cells, excluding flagged ones.
4. Avoid clicking on a mine to stay in the game. If you hit a mine, it's game over!
5. Win by correctly flagging all mines or revealing all safe cells.
